# Project Description
**DiagnoseIt** is a web application to help users predict the possible diseases from their symptoms. 
More often that not, we spend time googling what is wrong with us when we experience some symptoms. I wanted to create a consolidated site where users can select their symptoms from a list and immediately be well aware of the possible diseases that they might have. Upon identification of the possible diseases, users are provided with description of the disease as well as the precautions to prevent further damage.
